Hereâ€™s a description of my one to one combat game:

"It is an intense, strategic fighting game where two opponents face off in a best-of-three-rounds battle. Players control their characters using unique moves mapped to the keys {r, q, d, x, w} for the left player and {i,j,l,p,u,}
for right player ,each delivering distinct attacks or defenses. For advanced players, combining moves with Shift unlocks powerful combo attacks, adding depth and excitement to the gameplay.
The first player to win two out of three rounds emerges as the champion, offering a thrilling and skill-based experience in each match."
